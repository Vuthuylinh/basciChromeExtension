 # What I've learned:
  - An extension must fulfill a single purpose
  - Extension files are zipped into a single .crx package that the user downloads and installs
  - Built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - manifest.json file is required

  # Steps to create basic Chrome extension:
  Step1: Create  a new directory to store the extension's files: 
  - Step2: add a file called manifest.json (required)
  - Step3: add file:  popup.html
  - Step4: add image/icon (this case it's book_icon.png)
  - Step4: add file: popup.js
  - Step5: update manifest.json with the files added above
